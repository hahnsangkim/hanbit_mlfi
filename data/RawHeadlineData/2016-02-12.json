NAND bit output is expected to continue drifting sideways through much of the rest of FY16, and then ramp steadily with a fairly steep slope through FY17, driven, we think, by ramping 3D NAND output. The FY17 vs FY15 expected CAGR for NAND bit shipments is 30-40% ... The 2 year CAGR, FY17 vs FY15, for average cost per bit is expected to be down 15-25% for DRAM and down 20-30% for NAND.\"</li>\n<li>In its <a href=\"http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ABEA-45YXOQ/1504236134x0x875021/4BEAA02E-BBC2-402C-A51D-B3B2C6B8C3D4/Winter_Analyst_Day_2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">conference slides</a> (.pdf), Micron forecast DRAM and NAND bit demand will respectively see ~25% and ~40% CAGRs from 2016-2019, with the high-margin server/storage market delivering 40% and 60% CAGRs. PCs are expected to account for less than 20% of DRAM bit demand by 2019.</li>\n<li>On its list of 2016 operating priorities, Micron includes ramping 20nm DRAM and 3D NAND, and commercializing <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/2663365-intel-micron-unveil-breakthrough-3d-xpoint-memory-tech-shares-higher\" target=\"_blank\">3D XPoint</a>.
