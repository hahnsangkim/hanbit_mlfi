AAPL|Apple (AAPL -2.6%) is now seeing a decent post-earnings selloff. Aside from the margin issues, the Street is likely concerned about Apple's relatively soft European and Asia-Pac performance.

U.S. and Japanese sales grew much faster thanks to iPhone share gains - could the Japanese gains finally lead to a deal with NTT DoCoMo?

MSFT|LinkedIn's (LNKD -9.9%) below-consensus guidance is likely conservative, Goldman declares as the company gives back some of its giant 2013 gains.

Not accounting for post-earnings estimate changes, LinkedIn currently trades at 87x 2014E EPS and 9.4x 2014E sales.
